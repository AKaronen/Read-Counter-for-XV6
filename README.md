# HT2
Implementation of a counter for system call read() in the xv6 operating system environment. Qemu is required for running xv6, not provided here. For little documentation on the implementation, refer to KÃ¤yttis_HT2.pdf above. Go to the xv6-public folder, run make and make qemu to run the OS on the qemu-emulator. 
QEMU is downloadable here: https://www.qemu.org/download/
